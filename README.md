# The Family Recipe Book

## Background
There's probably a billion other projects out there like this, but sometimes you just wanna make something yourself (while also learning react). The purpose of this project is to create a family recipe book that any member can easily contribute to.

***

### Planned Features

#### Easy, trackable editability

Members within a family should be able to easily modify recipes, but in a way that tracks their modifications and results. That way if a certain family member prefers method A of preparing a dish, they can modify it to their tastes and share the base version with other members.

#### Recipe uploads: from scratch or "inspired by"

Members can will be able to create a recipe via two methods: from scratch (creating the recipe themselves) or "inspiration" (uploading a link). Either way, they will be able to make edits and add notes to specific ingredients *and* instructions.

#### Organize, plan, schedule

Family members might want to categorize certain recipes as different types of meals. Example categories can include snacks, brunch, dessert ect. They might also want to tag certain things as healthy, low fat, high fiber, good for meal planning and many more. Lastly, there could be a certain event or holiday that multiple members may want to add different recipes to.
