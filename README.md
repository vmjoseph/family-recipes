# The Family Recipe Book

## Background
There's probably a billion other projects out there like this, but sometimes you just wanna make something yourself (while also learning react). The purpose of this project is to create a family recipe book that any member can easily contribute to.

***

### Planned Features üòã

#### Easy, trackable editability üìù

Members within a family should be able to easily modify recipes, but in a way that tracks their modifications and results. That way if a certain family member prefers method A of preparing a dish, they can modify it to their tastes and share the base version with other members.

#### Recipe uploads: from scratch or "inspired by" ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Members can will be able to create a recipe via two methods: from scratch (creating the recipe themselves) or "inspiration" (uploading a link). Either way, they will be able to make edits and add notes to specific ingredients *and* instructions.

#### Organize, plan, schedule üìÜ

Family members might want to categorize certain recipes as different types of meals. Example categories can include snacks, brunch, dessert ect. They might also want to tag certain things as healthy, low fat, high fiber, good for meal planning and many more. 


For dinner parties, special events, and holidays, there's a ton of things to do, take the planning out of it.

The basic features of the planner will include:

- Allow a member to create an event and dictate the amounts of different parts of the meal (ie 2 appetizers, 1 entre, 4 side dishes)
- Other members can vote and submit entries for each category
- As the event approaches, a customized reminder will send notifications for requests to vote or add dishes. These will continue going until the deadline approaches.
- Once the event deadline (not the actual event, but when you'd want things finalized) passes, members can choose which dishes they will be responsible for
- For next version: smart cooking plan generation. Using NLP, dissect which parts of a recipe can be prepped before hand, when to start cooking to finish by a certain time, and much more

#### Kitchen profiling üçΩÔ∏è

Not every kitchen is built the same. We'll create a profile of your kitchen (maybe amazon connections in the future for updating?) and tailor recipes for you.

When event planning, this can be used as the set location to help you plan for what can be made concurrently.


#### General Meal Planning :stew:
Looking for something quick and easy? Trying to figure out how many days something should last before planning something new? Members will be able to build their own meal plans (which can be shared) that can accommodate their schedules.

Filter recipes by ATTC (Actual time to cook), ingredients you have, or special equipment required. 
 
You can also rate recipes and favorite recipes for quick access and score based sorting.
